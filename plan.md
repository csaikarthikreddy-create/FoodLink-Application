# FoodLink - Food Wastage Reduction Platform

## Project Overview
Build a full-stack application connecting event organizers with NGOs to reduce food wastage by facilitating real-time surplus food distribution.

---

## Phase 1: Core Data Models, Authentication & Event Organizer Dashboard ✅
- [x] Set up SQLite database with Event, NGO, and User models
- [x] Implement user authentication system (register, login, logout) with role-based access (Organizer vs NGO)
- [x] Create Event Organizer Dashboard UI with navigation, event list, and profile sections
- [x] Build event creation form with fields: name, location (address + lat/lng), date, time, expected surplus amount
- [x] Implement event management: view all events, edit event details, mark surplus as available
- [x] Add event status tracking (Scheduled, Completed, Surplus Available, Distributed)

---

## Phase 2: NGO Dashboard & Registration System ✅
- [x] Create NGO registration form with organization details, location (address + lat/lng), service area radius
- [x] Build NGO Dashboard UI showing nearby events with available surplus
- [x] Implement NGO preferences: notification channels (Slack, WhatsApp, Email), operating hours
- [x] Add geolocation filtering logic to find NGOs within 10-mile radius of events (Haversine formula)
- [x] Create NGO profile management: edit contact details, update preferences, view notification history
- [x] Display event cards with distance calculation, surplus details, and organizer contact info

---

## Phase 3: Map Integration & Real-time Notification System ✅
- [x] Install and configure reflex-enterprise for map component
- [x] Build interactive map view showing all events (with surplus) and registered NGOs as markers
- [x] Implement map clustering for better visualization, color-coded markers (events vs NGOs)
- [x] Add map interaction: click markers for details, fly-to location on selection
- [x] Set up notification system: detect NGOs within radius when organizer marks surplus available
- [x] Create notification templates and mock delivery system (console logs for Slack, WhatsApp, Email)
- [x] Build notification history view for both organizers and NGOs
- [x] Add real-time notification badge/counter in NGO dashboard

---

## Phase 4: External API Integration (Twilio, Slack, SendGrid) ✅
- [x] Install required SDKs: twilio, slack-sdk, sendgrid
- [x] Integrate Twilio API for WhatsApp notifications with event details and organizer contact
- [x] Integrate Slack API for Slack channel/DM notifications with formatted event cards
- [x] Integrate SendGrid API for email notifications with HTML templates
- [x] Implement fallback logic: if primary channel fails, try secondary channels
- [x] Add notification delivery status tracking and error logging
- [x] Create notification service module with template generation for all channels

## Phase 5: Enhanced Features & Mobile Responsiveness
- [ ] Implement responsive design: mobile-first layout, collapsible sidebars, touch-friendly controls
- [ ] Add event search and filtering: by date, location, surplus type, status
- [ ] Build analytics dashboard: total events, food distributed, NGOs served, impact metrics
- [ ] Implement notification preferences testing UI for NGOs to verify channels
- [ ] Add event confirmation workflow: NGO accepts pickup, organizer confirms distribution
- [ ] Create app-wide notifications/toast system for user feedback
- [ ] Add loading states, skeleton screens, and error boundaries
- [ ] Implement dark mode toggle (optional enhancement)

---

## Phase 6: Data Validation, Security & Production Readiness
- [ ] Add comprehensive form validation: email, phone, coordinates, required fields
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for notifications to prevent spam
- [ ] Add data sanitization and SQL injection protection
- [ ] Create user roles and permissions middleware
- [ ] Build audit logging for sensitive actions (surplus marked, NGO notified, distribution confirmed)
- [ ] Add database migration support and seed data for testing
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Create deployment documentation and environment variable guide
- [ ] Add terms of service and privacy policy pages
- [ ] Final UI/UX polish: consistency check, accessibility improvements, performance optimization

## Notes
- Use SQLite for development, easily switchable to PostgreSQL for production
- Geolocation uses Haversine formula for accurate distance calculations
- API integrations configured with environment variables: TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN, SLACK_BOT_TOKEN, SENDGRID_API_KEY
- Map requires reflex-enterprise package (pip install reflex-enterprise)
- Mobile responsiveness tested at 375px (mobile), 768px (tablet), 1024px+ (desktop)
- Color scheme: Blue primary (#3B82F6), Gray secondary (#6B7280), Success green (#10B981), Warning orange (#F59E0B)
- **Phase 4 Complete**: All notification APIs (Twilio WhatsApp, Slack, SendGrid) integrated with real-time delivery tracking
